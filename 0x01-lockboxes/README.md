# 0x01. Lockboxes

## Description
This project contains a Python implementation of an algorithm to determine if all boxes in a set of locked boxes can be opened. Each box may contain keys to other boxes, and the challenge is to determine if it's possible to unlock all boxes starting with the first box, which is initially unlocked.

## Files
- `0-lockboxes.py`: Contains the implementation of the `canUnlockAll` function.
- `0-main.py`: A script to test the `canUnlockAll` function with various inputs.

## Requirements
- Python 3.4.3
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- PEP 8 style (version 1.7.x)

## Usage
To run the test script:
./0-main.py
